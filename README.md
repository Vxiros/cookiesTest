# cookiesTest
A simple application using cookies for ECE NTUA courses "Network and Applications".

This web application uses Apache Tomcat as a server.

In order to use the application clone or download the repository and then copy the folder named "kafedares" in to the path ../jakarta-tomcat-3.3.2/webapps/ (I use tomcat version 3.3.2, you can use other version either), startup tomcat and then open ../jakarta-tomcat-3.3.2/webapps/kafedares/index.html with a broswer. If you have issues with java errrors try to compile kafedaresServlet.java and the put in ../jakarta-tomcat-3.3.2\webapps\kafedares\WEB-INF\classes the new kafedaresServlet.class.
